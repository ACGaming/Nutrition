# Nutrition

Nutrition is a highly configurable mod to enable the creation of health systems in Minecraft.

[See releases tab for downloads.](https://github.com/WesCook/Nutrition/releases)

Through its config files, Nutrition allows you to define custom food groups (called nutrients), categorize foods by ID or ore dictionary, and enable potion effects to apply based on player nutrition levels.

By default, Nutrition comes configured with the classic five food group system: dairy, fruit, grain, protein, and vegetables.  However many different systems are possible.  Some examples include:

* A spicy tolerance bar, where eating enough spicy foods will grant a permanent resistance to fire.
* A zombie simulation where you must constantly eat brains/flesh to avoid negative effects.
* Gluten intolerance.  Eat bread, get sick.
